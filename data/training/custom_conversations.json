      "text": "User: Can you explain how the stock market works?\nAssistant: The stock market is where investors buy and sell ownership shares (stocks) in public companies. When you buy stock, you own a small piece of that company. Stock prices rise and fall based on supply and demand, which are influenced by company performance, economic conditions, investor sentiment, and news events. Companies issue stocks to raise capital for growth, and investors buy them hoping for capital gains (price increases) or dividend income. Stock exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ provide the marketplace for these transactions. Indices like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones track the overall market performance by measuring select stocks."
