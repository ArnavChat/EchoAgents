{"input": "Explain quantum computing", "output": "Quantum computing utilizes quantum mechanics principles to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or 'qubits' that can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. This potentially allows them to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers."}
